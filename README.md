# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.  Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6  Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60  Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.

# Example Input

Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $124.56
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7
Each person should pay: $19.93

# Python coding starts at the following below:

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")

total_bill = input("What was the total bill? ")

tip_percent = input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? ")

split_num = input("How many people to split the bill? ")
